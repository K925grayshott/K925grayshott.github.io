    title: "What ?"
    excerpt: >
      After an initial discussion about your child's needs and you decide to employ Chattertots to help, the next course of action will be one of the following:

      - 6-8 weekly 1:1 therapy sessions followed by a short break and then a review.

      - Advice or activities to try at home and then a review in around 3 months onward referral to other services.

      - a school/nursery visit to gather more information or to liaise with school staff.

      - a home program followed by a review at a later date.

      
      We use a number of techniques, services and apps and have training in [different approaches](/specialisms) to help your child and get the most from our sessions together.
