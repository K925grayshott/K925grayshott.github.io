     I can securely transport you & your pet to the Vets or Dog Groomers, & wait to transport you home again.

      We would meet for an initial no obligation pre service visit to discuss you & your dog's individual requirements. This could be at your home or on a short walk if you prefer.

      I do ask that your dog is fully vaccinated with up to date flea & worming.
