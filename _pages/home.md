    excerpt: >
      We would meet for an initial no obligation pre service visit to discuss you and your dog's individual requirements. This could be at your home or on a short walk if you prefer.

      I do ask that your dog is fully vaccinated with up to date flea and worming.

      My wife Emma and I have a young son, a beautiful Sprollie ( Border Collie, Springer Spaniel Cross ) called Bonnie and 2 cats, Pepper & Peach. My family was the driving force behind me leaving my Sales Kitchen Designer job with its long hours & weekends to start K925.
