    title: "About Me"
    excerpt: >
      My name is Steph, I am a keen animal lover who has had the opportunity to follow my dream of working with animals. 



      My wife Emma and I have a young son, a beautiful Sprollie ( Border Collie, Springer Spaniel Cross ) called Bonnie and 2 cats, Pepper and Peach. My family was the driving force behind me leaving my Sales Kitchen Designer job with its long hours and weekends to start K925.



      My dog walking and pet sitting service covers Grayshott and surrounding areas.
  
     
      
      I am fully insured and have completed diploma courses in Dog Walking and Pet Sitting which includes Animal First Aid and also in Canine Communication.

      
      
      I aim to provide a professional, reliable service and quality care for your furry friends.

      We would meet for an initial no obligation pre- service visit to discuss you and your dog's individual requirements. 
      
      
      
      This could be at your home or on a short walk if you prefer.



      I do ask that your dog is fully vaccinated with up to date flea and worming.
